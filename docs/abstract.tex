Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) has become a classic machine learning
problem with many successful algorithms for classifying both printed and hand
written text. In this paper, we create a classifier which classifies texture
based symbols of terrains on maps in two dimensions. Three classification
methods are implemented including a feature-based approach, a gold standard
image comparison method, and an approach based on symbol proximity. The results
show that the proximity based approach, presented here, can predict with high
confidence, 94\%, the identity of an unknown symbol, using only the surrounding
symbols.
