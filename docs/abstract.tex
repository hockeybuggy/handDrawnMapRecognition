Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) has become a classic machine learning
problem with many successful algorithms for classifying both printed and hand
written text. In this paper, we create a classifier which classifies
texture based symbols of terrains on maps in two dimensions. Three
classification methods are implemented and the results show that the proximity
based approach presented
here can predict with high confidence, 94\%, the identity of an unknown symbol,
using only the surrounding symbols.
