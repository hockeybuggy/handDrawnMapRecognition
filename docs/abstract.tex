Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)
has become a classic machine learning problem with many successful algorithms for classifying
both printed and hand written text. In this paper, we attempt to create a classifier which
classifies texture based symbols of terrains on maps in two dimensions. We compare three
classification methods and show that the proximity based approach presented here can predict
with high confidence, 94\%, the identity of an unknown symbol using only the surrounding symbols.
