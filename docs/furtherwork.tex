Future expansion of this design is possible and encouraged. After asessing the results, we have identified various aspects of our current design that can be changed in order to improve functionality and classification results.

Future work may include combining the proximity classifier with the gold 
comparison classifier to improve accuracy. 

Feature based classification may see improvement from considering other
transformations of the pixels when calculating statistics, such as distance
from the centre.
