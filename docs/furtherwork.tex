One thing that we would like to work on the in future is to use the methods in
conjunction to play off of each others strengths. For example if we were to run
the Gold Comparison method to get a rough approximation of the layout of the
shapes, we could then use the Proximity method to clean up the results.
Combining method would allow a more hands off approach to solving the problem

Feature based classification may see improvement from considering other
transformations of the pixels when calculating statistics, such as distance
from the centre.

An experiment that we would like to run is to use ``ideal'' gold images rather
then mean gold images. We suspect that performance of the gold method could be
improved by using images selected from the images that illustrate the intended
shape of the character.

Another approach that we would like to attempt is to limit the region of cell
image used in the feature-based method. By only taking statistics of smaller
sections of the images we could eliminate areas of the image that are largely
noise, such as the edges of each cell.
