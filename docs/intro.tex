The problem of Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) in Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning has received much attention in past years.
This field of study has focused on the classification of \emph{handwritten}  or
\emph{typewritten} letters and numbers.  The novelty of this project will be in
the development of an algorithm which recognizes characters, or more generally
symbols, arranged to form words in \emph{two} dimensions. The practical
application proposed here will be the development of an algorithm for
recognizing hand drawn cartography. To this end, we have defined a small set of
symbols to represent various terrains: grass, mountains, bodies of water, and
more. Each symbol will be drawn into a single cell on a standard sheet of grid
paper and scanned into a computer. Using the scanned images, several
algorithms will learn to recognize the symbols cell-by-cell as well as in the
context of the surrounding cells. In order to demonstrate
the utility of such an algorithm, we propose an application which reads a
hand drawn map and produces a computer generated image of the same map. To do this,
we will use the software tool WEKA\cite{hall2009} to assist us in the creation
of various classifiers.
