Each of our classification methods has its strengths and weaknesses.  The
feature based method is able to recognize arbitrary features and is very easy
to extend by adding new filters.  The proximity method works extremely well
with the set of maps we chose because there are many common patterns in their
composition.  However, to detect these patterns in a data set the proximity
classifier needs an accurate representation of the map. This method has the
added benefit of having its output be the same as its input, which means it can
improve its output iteratively.  The gold comparison method is able to classify
symbols fairly well. However, this method requires gold images as input and the
number of features in the output is dependent on the number of gold images
(which makes generalization more difficult).
