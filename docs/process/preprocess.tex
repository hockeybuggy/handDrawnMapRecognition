Before analysis, the data must be preproccessed in order to standardize image
properties and reduce the risk of errors in classififcation. A collection
of scripts are run on each of the maps prior to classification to
rotate, scale, and remove the blue lines using colour filter masks.
Colour information is removed from the images by converting them to black
and white. Each cell is scaled to a standard 75 by 75 pixels and
seperated from the map such that each cell contains a single symbol.
The results of preprocessing are shown in Figure \ref{figure:preprocess}
